<h1>Excerpt</h1>
<p>Hello, God...This is Peter Parker. Can I ask a favor?<br></p><br>
<p>I know I've been your personal cat toy for the past few years...but can we not do that to me again for a while?<br></p><br>
<p>Not real long. I know the odds on that are about zero...but just for a little while.<br></p><br>
<p>Say, 50 or 60 years? I mean, that's not long in your terms, right?<br></p>
<p>Just kidding God, just kidding.<br></p><br>
<p>But I'll bet you knew that, didn't you?<br></p><br>
